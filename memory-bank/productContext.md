# Product Context: Fermanis & Sons Lawncare Website

## Why This Project Exists

### The Business Problem
Fermanis & Sons Lawncare is a family-operated lawn care business that needs a professional digital presence to:
- **Replace word-of-mouth limitations**: While neighborhood referrals are valuable, they limit growth potential
- **Compete with larger companies**: Established lawn care companies have professional websites and online booking
- **Capture modern customer behavior**: Today's homeowners research and book services online
- **Establish credibility**: A professional website builds trust before the first customer interaction
- **Streamline operations**: Reduce time spent on phone calls and manual scheduling

### The Market Opportunity
- **Local residential focus**: Target homeowners who value family businesses and personalized service
- **Service differentiation**: Emphasize quality products (Anderson, PGF) and family expertise
